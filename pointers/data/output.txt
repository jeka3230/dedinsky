And being frank she lends to those are free.
For having traffic with thyself alone,
Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,
Profitless usurer, why dost thou use
So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?
The bounteous largess given thee to give?
Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse
Then how, when nature calls thee to be gone,
Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive.
Thy unused beauty must be tomb'd with thee,
Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend
Upon thyself thy beauty's legacy?
What acceptable audit canst thou leave?
Which, used, lives th' executor to be.
