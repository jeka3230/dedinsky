Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend
Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,
Which, used, lives th' executor to be.
What acceptable audit canst thou leave?
Thy unused beauty must be tomb'd with thee,
Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive.
Then how, when nature calls thee to be gone,
Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse
The bounteous largess given thee to give?
So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?
Profitless usurer, why dost thou use
For having traffic with thyself alone,
And being frank she lends to those are free.
Upon thyself thy beauty's legacy?
